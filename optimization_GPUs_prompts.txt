Keeping all the optimization needed in mind.
The optimizations are utilization of resources (memory, GPUs, CPUs, disk i/o, etc...) and ensure video production time is under 30 min even for 	A100-80G-PCIe with 2 GPUs without losing quality for 1 hour long video
Evaluate time for production after optimization for 2,4,8 GPUs in the same instance




Now, really dig up both repos and review EVERY FILE from both
Mine: https://github.com/ngothientuong/Wan2.1
Source code: https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1

Tell me again, if I'm fully abiding by the source code for app.py, DockerFile, additional-requirements? Is there any other files or parameters I'm missing? Remember, this is supposed to ensure optimizations!

Ensure no packages incompability nor conflicts and check against what's from the base images as well

Important: Do not fucking assume anything or generate something from your general understanding like last time! Go do fucking review on every file!
